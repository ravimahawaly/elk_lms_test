Create a directory which will help to track the last updated value of column
====================================================================================
Why? 
because ==> an error occured which was not tracking the last value and again full data of oracle injecting to elasticsearch, 
so to solve this error we have created this file which we will mount to container to track last updated value and helps in 
sending only incremental data to elasticsearch.

#	mkdir -p /elk_stack/logstash/.logstash_meta
#	chmod 777 /elk_stack/logstash/.logstash_meta  
#	ls -la

# command to run logstash container for this pipeline 

#	docker run -d --name logstash --network elk_stack_elastic -p 5044:5044 -p 5000:5000 -v /elk_stack/logstash:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline
